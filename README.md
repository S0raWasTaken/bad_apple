# Bad Apple
A series of crates that I made to compile images/video into asciinema & play them.<br>
The end goal is to make a kernel & legacy bootloader that together play bad apple.

## Previews
You can find some previews in my [Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/@S0ra-)

## Crates
- **asciic**: An asciinema compiler.
- **asciild**: A procedural macro to link frames generated by [asciic](asciic/) on a Rust project. Go make your so desired Bad Apple kernel (or worse)!
- **bplay**: The asciinema player for frames generated with [asciic](asciic/).
